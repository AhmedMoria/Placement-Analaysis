# Job Recommendation Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a job recommendation dataset to uncover insights into hiring trends, job preferences, and candidate behaviors. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we identify key patterns and factors that influence job recommendations.

## 📊 Dataset Information
The dataset contains structured information about job postings, candidate profiles, and recommendation outcomes. Key attributes include:
- **Job ID**: Unique identifier for job listings.
- **Candidate ID**: Unique identifier for applicants.
- **Job Title, Industry, and Location**: Details about the job.
- **Candidate Skills, Experience, and Preferences**: Factors influencing job matches.
- **Recommendation Outcome**: Indicates if a candidate was recommended for a job.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis involves:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics of job postings and candidate distributions.
- **Visualization**:
  - Job industry distribution
  - Candidate experience levels
  - Skills demand vs. supply
  - Correlation between job features and recommendations

## 📈 Key Insights
Some of the insights derived include:
- The most in-demand skills and industries.
- Factors influencing successful recommendations.
- Trends in job postings and candidate preferences over time.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage
To run the analysis:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
python analysis.py
```

## 📌 Future Work
- Advanced feature engineering for deeper insights.
- Predictive modeling to forecast job recommendation success rates.
- Interactive dashboards for dynamic visualization.
